Project Overview:
This project was developed as part of a take-home exercise to demonstrate my skills in front-end development, state management, API integration, and responsive design. Weather Now offers up-to-date weather information including temperature, conditions, and other essential weather data, in an attractive and interactive interface.

Features:
City-Based Weather Search: Users can search for weather data by entering the city name.
Real-Time Data Fetching: Weather Now retrieves current weather information using the Open-Meteo API.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Dynamic Styling: The app features modern, stylish design elements, including background and text animations that vary with weather conditions.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, JavaScript (using Vite for fast, optimized builds)
API: Open-Meteo (for real-time weather data)
Styling: CSS with custom animations for a dynamic user interface

Usage:
Enter the name of any city in the search box.
Click the "Search" button to display current weather information for that location.
The app will display the temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant details for the city.

API:
This application uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch current weather data. The API is free and does not require an API key, making it simple to integrate and efficient for real-time data fetching.

Project Goals:
This project demonstrates:
API Integration: Skill in fetching and displaying data from an external API.
React State Management: Use of React's useState for handling and updating state.
Responsive Design Principles: Ensuring that the layout works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Error Handling: Managing API errors and displaying user-friendly error messages.
Visual Design: Creating a visually appealing, modern UI with animations and color schemes that vary with weather conditions.
